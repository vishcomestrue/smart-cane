# SMART-CANE

## Problem Statement

Visually Impaired people face many difficulties in their lives, especially when they are walking somewhere they are new. They know the distance of all the objects and obstacles in their home, and they remember it and freely roam in their home using that data. But when they reach out to new places with their standard walking stick, they face many difficulties using the standard walking stick(the plain white stick they use for walking). Some struggles that they face while using the standard stick are:
  - The standard stick cannot easily detect lowered and elevated surfaces. They struggle to find them and often end up losing their balance.
  - The standard stick can detect only objects in the vicinity of around 0.8 to 1 m and cannot see moving objects.
Not at all times, the public will stand for their helpðŸ˜¢. 

SMART WALKING STICK can help resolve this issue.
*This whole project is just a prototype and can work only at certain situations that a blind person faces in everyday life*
